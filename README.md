# CPT-Books
The files for my Custom Post Types for the 1st Olympus WordPress Meetup.</br>
It guides you through creating Custom Post Types, meta boxes and Custom Taxonomies for WordPress.</br>
This will work with a Child Theme of Twenty Seventeen.</br>
Feel Free to install and make any comment that you want. </br>
Happy Custom Post Type making!</br>

<b>Note: </b></br>
I suggest to use the method with mu-plugin to install and create your custom post type, meta boxes and custom taxonomies. So, drag and drop the `cpt.php` into this folder.
